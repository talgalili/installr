   * install.R - Updated the warning massage on install.R in case checkMD5sum fails.
   * updateR -
      ** added the to_checkMD5sums parameter to updateR (to be passed on to install.R() )

   * Fixed a bug in updateR, "Error in !install_R : 'install_R' is missing" (install_R was called in too early) (thanks to AC for the bug report!)


installr 0.8 (2013-03-05)
-------------------------

FIXES FOR CRAN SUBMISSION:
   * Fixed some spelling mistakes in DESCRIPTION,
   * Made sure to run the checks in the latest R version (R 2.15.3, oh the irony)
   * Changed update.R to be called updateR (in order to avoid confusing it as an S3 variation to 'update')
   * installr 0.8 is to be shipped to CRAN.


My thanks goes to Prof Brian Ripley for his help.

TODO for future releases:
-------------------------
	* Better integration with the "global library" strategy
	* make the os.manage work by running an Rscript, in order to allow for their use in long running of knitr/Sweave projects.
   * Add a rate function for the package
   * Add automatic check for a new R version every X time.
   * a way to copy/move Rprofile.site from one installation to the next such as "C:\Program Files\R\R-2.15.2\etc\Rprofile.site" to "C:\Program Files\R\R-2.15.3\etc\Rprofile.site"? (requested by: Farrel Buchinsky)
   * Add more checks for when copying library folders. If it is found the user has more than one library - show him the options of what he is copying from where to where - and ask the user to approve.  If he denies, to ask him which folder to choose "from", and which "to" copy the libraries into.
   *add a general package help file.
   * Fix install.RStudio to act differently in case it is being run from within RStudio (keeping the installation file for the user to run it)
   *  Add control on which mirror to use when running install.R()
   *  allow a user to browse and find the old and new R installation on his system, in case there is a change in file directory from the standard directory structure.
