installR 0.8.1
--------------

NEW FEATURE:
   * install.URL - added a "wait" parameter with default as F (it now means that R doesn't wait for the installation of the software to finish before it releases the console).  And also "..." with access to the shell command run.

BUG FIXES:
   * Fixed a bug in updateR, to make sure it will be able to open the new Rgui, and also close the old R.


installR 0.8
------------

FIXES FOR CRAN SUBMISSION:
   * Fixed some spelling mistakes in DESCRIPTION,
   * Made sure to run the checks in the latest R version (R 2.15.3, oh the irony)
   * Changed update.R to be called updateR (in order to avoid confusing it as an S3 variation to 'update')


My thanks goes to Prof Brian Ripley for his help.

   * ask.user.yn.question - Asks the user for one yes/no question.
