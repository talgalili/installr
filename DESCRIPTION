Description: The 'installr' package aims at making the process of updating R on
    Windows as easy as possible. Also, the package contains a (growing) set of
    functions for allowing users to install new software (on Windows OS) using
    R. By simply running the installr() function, the user can easily select
    (via a GUI interface) a software to install. There are also dedicated
    functions for installing each software, such as: updateR(),
    install.Rtools(), install.pandoc(), and many more. While for Linux users,
    the installation process of new software may be just running a short line
    of code, for the regular Windows user it often includes browsing online,
    finding the latest version, downloading it, running the installer, and
    deleting the installation file. All of these steps are automatically done
    using functions in this package.
