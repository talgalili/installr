Description: The 'installr' package aims at making the process of updating R on
    Windows as easy as possible, the main function for this purpose is the
    updateR() function. Also, the package contains a set of functions allowing
    users to install new software (on Windows OS) using R. While for Linux
    users, the installation process of new software may be just running a short
    line of code, for the regular Windows user it often includes browsing
    online, finding the latest version, downloading it, running the installer,
    and deleting the installation file. All of these steps are automatically
    done using functions in this package.
